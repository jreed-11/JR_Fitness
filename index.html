				Had a great workout this afternoon. Equipment is spaced apart and clean.
				Wipes, paper towels, and antibacterial spray are located in each area
				for use. There is a wide selection of machines and staff were very
				helpful and showed that all hygienic measures were in place and being
				followed for everyone's safety and comfort. Rooms are spacious and
				temperature is kept cool.
